abstract: Advancements in wound healing and chronic wound analysis have highlighted key challenges in managing non-healing wounds, often linked to conditions such as diabetes, vascular deficiencies, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease. Non-healing wounds are marked by bacterial imbalances, disrupted growth factors, and heightened inflammatory responses that lead to tissue degradation rather than repair. Effective wound segmentation is essential for monitoring and promoting healing, and current methods range from traditional image processing techniques relying on handcrafted features to deep learning approaches that extract features autonomously. In this study, we propose a hybrid convolutional model combining VGG19, U-Net, and EfficientNet to achieve high accuracy in wound area segmentation. Utilizing a dataset of 2,000 foot ulcer images, we trained and evaluated the model, demonstrating its superior performance through extensive experiments and analysis compared to existing segmentation techniques.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This study introduces a hybrid convolutional model combining VGG19, U-Net, and EfficientNet for accurate wound segmentation, addressing challenges in non-healing wound management. Trained on 2,000 foot ulcer images, the model outperforms existing methods in precision and effectiveness.
